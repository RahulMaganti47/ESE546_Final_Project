## Install the OpenAI gym environment:

`pip install gym`

Next, find where gym was installed: `pip where gym`. Locate the directory `gym/gym/envs/classic_control` and copy the code from [our cartpole file](setup_environment/cartpole.py) into your file.

Finally, change your directory into `gym/gym/envs` and locate `__init__.py`. Copy the code from [our init file](setup_environment/__init__.py) into your file.


## Run code

Depending on which version you want to run:

`python main.py`

## Misc.

The file `reptile_layout.py` is a sketch of how the algorithm works.
